	<h2> with some boring work experience </h2>
		<p> I have a Master Degree in Business </p>
		<p> and I have been working as a recruiter for 2 years in France </p>	

    <h3> who has been travelling </h3>
    	<p> I decided to quit my job and to travel because I could.</p>
		<p> I went to South East Asia, Australie and New Zealand. </p>

    <h4> and ended up in New Zealand. </h4>
    	<p> I enjoy the culture and the beer :)</p>
		<p> More than that I found my partner here. </p>

    <h5> I love to learn new stuff  </h5>
    	<p> During the last year, I have learned: 
    	<ul>
    	<li>Thai Boxing,</li>
    	<li>scuba diving,</li>
    	<li>and driving on the left side.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<br> Now I am really keen to learn programming. </p>

    <h6> and I am excited about EDA. </h6>
    	<p> This first few moments working from home are already great. I can't wait to meet up the Weka Cohort and learn pregramming together. </p
