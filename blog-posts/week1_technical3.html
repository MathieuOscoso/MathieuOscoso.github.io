			<h2> Why is JavaScript so popular ? </h2>
			<p id="text"><br> I have been searching and reading on the internet the reasons why is Javascript so popular and I listed the main one below:
			<br> - Because it's an easy language compare to C or C++ with a simpler syntax.
			<br> - There are a lot of libraries that help you to create object that makes Javascript so convenient ot use.
			<br> - It looks like Javascript is very light weight and fast on the client side so the speed is greatly improved. And you can also create your server with Javascript without the need of any other languages.
			<br> - Javascript is supported by every browsers. It is the defacto language of all browsers.
			<br> - It is open source so free, fast evolving, there is a lot of free materials, projects and libraries on the web.

			<br><br>On another way Javascript I found some people saying that it is the hardest language to debug on cross browser testing.

			<br><br> Despite this debug issue, JavaScript is considered by his supporters and a large part of the programming community as the Ultimate Scripting Language and is growing even more day by day.
