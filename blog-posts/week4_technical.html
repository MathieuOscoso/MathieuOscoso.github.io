			<h2> C# .NET </h2>
			<p id="text"><br>Enumerable Methods: ArrayList.IndexOf 
			<br>
			<br> ArrayList is an array with a non defined number of element in it.
			<br> 
			<br> IndexOf is a method that searchs string or numbers and return the zero index based (or the position) of the first occurence of a letter or an object.
			<br>
			<br> So for a given ArrayList 
			<br>
			<br>// cs 
			<br>ArrayList myNumbers = new ArrayList ();
			<br>myNumbers.Add(1);
			<br>myNumbers.Add(4);
			<br>myNumbers.Add(2);
			<br>myNumbers.Add(7);
			<br>myNumbers.Add(2);
			<br>myNumbers.Add(19);
			<br>
			<br> // Say we want to know were is located the first occurence of the number 2  within the list.
			<br>
			<br> // We declare the object.
			<br>
			<br> int theNumber = 2;
			<br> Console.WriteLine("The first occurence of " + theNumber + " is at the position" + myNumbers.IndexOf( theNumber ) + " in the list")
			<br> // cs

			<br> We can use this Method to locate an occurence from the beginning of the list, as we did, but also we can use locate an occurence between a certain point of the list to another.

			<br> // cs
			<br> int theNumber = 2;
			<br> myNumbers.IndexOf( theNumber, 5) // between the fifth number and the end of the list
			<br> myNumbers.IndexOf( theNumber, 5, 9) // between the fifth and the ninth
			<br> myNumbers.IndexOf( theNumber, 16) // if the number is outside of the list the method will return -1.

			<br> An exercice to practice this method.
			<br>
			<br> Within the following list, find the position of the occurence "how" in the following list using the following parameters:
			<br> - from the beginning to the end of the list
			<br> - from the index 5 to the end
			<br> - from the index 5 to 9
			<br> - from the index 12
			<br>
			<br> // cs
			<br>ArrayList myWords = new ArrayList ();
			<br>myWords.Add( "It");
			<br>myWords.Add( "is");
			<br>myWords.Add( "not");
			<br>myWords.Add( "how");
			<br>myWords.Add( "much");
			<br>myWords.Add( "we");
			<br>myWords.Add( "have");
			<br>myWords.Add( "but");
			<br>myWords.Add( "how");
			<br>myWords.Add( "much");
			<br>myWords.Add( "we");
			<br>myWords.Add( "enjoy");
			<br> // cs

			<br> Your answer should be 3, 7, 7, -1.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<br> Arrays vs. Hashes. What are they? 
			<br> Array = a list of element that are stored like in a table with a position automatically given from the beginning to the end.
			<br> Hashes = a list of element that aren't ordered but from groups. They have the name of a "group" called a key that is arbitrary choosen by you.

			<br> They role is to store data that will be accessed later on.

			<br> Each one have a different use and if you have a long list of data to store, that need to be ordered but without knowing the number of information you will store I would recomment to use array. 
			<br>
			<br> On another hand, hashes are way more secured as you need the key to access to the information, in the way that some password method use the hashtables to confirm that a key correspond to an element. 
			<br>
			<br> A good strategy would always be to ask yourself. What am I gonna use this list for? Do I know in advance the number of data I will store? What kind of data will it be? Do I need to secure this data?
