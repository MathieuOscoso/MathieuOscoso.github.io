                        <p>Posted on <time datetime="2014-08-23T11:36:45+12:00">August 23th 2014</time> by <a href="#">Mathieu Oscoso</a> - <a href="#comments">1 comments</a></p>
                </header>
                <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/Mat/Desktop/EDA/MathieuOscoso.github.io/unit1_projects/images/imdb.jpg " alt="IMDB logo" width="150" height="100" /></a></p>
                <p>IMBD is one of my favourite websites because I enjoy movies and I can preview trailers for upcoming movies.
                My eye is initially drawn the ‘featured trailers’ which is laid out at the op of the page on a carousel. I would describe the website as clear, informative, segmented, simple and easy. The IMDB website contains information regarding upcoming movies, television and celebrity news. The website gives free access to the largest database of movies online where members can add comments and rate the movies. Five adjectives I would use to describe the content are: entertaining, informative, practical and serious. It is fairly simple to locate anything I am looking for on the homepage and in any other page on the site. This is made easier through the internal search engine which is located at the top of each page. The content is organised through specific topics such as movies, box-office, television and showtime. It is easy to navigate and find what I’m looking for through the different headings. After being on the site for a long period of time I feel quite content because I have generally discovered new movies that I want to watch and have read critical reviews about movies I have previously watched. The website sells access to a database of contacts within the entertainment industry. I have not purchased anything from IMDB because I am not working within the entertainment industry.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.lequipe.fr/" target="_blank"><img src="http://lol.net/p/lequipe-fr-mini.jpg" alt="L'equipe logo" width="150" height="100" /></a></p>
                <p>L’equipe is one of my favourite websites because I enjoy following sport and it is the best website to follow French football leagues. L’equipe is the supporting website for the most popular sports newspaper in France. My eye is drawn to the main article on the page which features a large image and headline. I don’t think this is the most important area of the site as the featured article does not always interest me. I would describe the website as interactive, informative, organised and visual. The problem the website solves is that it offers the latest information regarding sports news. You do not have to wait for the 6pm news. Five adjectives that describe the content and purpose of the site are: informative, up to date, dynamic and fun. It is very easy to find what you are looking for from the homepage, you simply select the sport you are interested in which will take you to a dedicated page with up to date news. It is really easy to locate what you are looking for on other pages. Once you are within the sport you are interested in, there is a clickable, visual list of all of the teams. It is easy to browse the content of the site because although there is a lot of information, it is delivered in short, succinct snippets which is easy to process. After being on the site for a while I feel bored and I feel like I am re-reading things. The site does not directly sell anything but hosts a lot of advertisements.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://developers.google.com/youtube/images/YouTube-logo-full_color.png" width="150" height="100" /></a></p>
                <p>YouTube is one of my favourite sites because I love watching videos and there is a huge variety of content available. The first area of the site my eye is drawn to is the recommendations at the very top of the page. I don’t think this is the most important part of the website, I would consider the search bar the most important part. I would describe YouTube as entertaining, informative, basic, organised and easy. The problem the website solves is it cures boredom and is highly entertaining. Five adjectives that describe the content and purpose of the site are: sharing videos. It is extremely easy to find what you are looking for from the homepage because the search bar is obvious against the starkness of the site. It is easy to navigate through from other pages because the search bar doesn’t change in size or location as you move through the site. It can become quite overwhelming when browsing through the content because there are so many suggestions and recommendations you are not quite sure where to go next. After being on YouTube for a long period of time you feel like you have wasted a lot of time watching videos that are not necessarily informative. The site does not sell any products directly, but it hosts advertisements within videos. Some advertisements can be skipped, while others need to be viewed before you can watch what you actually came to watch.</p>
